# Results: 
Using the visualizations you have in your Tableau Story, describe the results of each visualization underneath the image.
## Page 1: August 2019 Summary
In August 2019 there were just over 2.3 million bike rides with data collected. The ~65% of all riders are male and the vast majority of them are subscribers. The majority of non-subscribers (ie customers) are listed as gender unknow suggesting that non-subscribed riders may not be prompted to give details such as their gender. 

## Page 2: Bike Riders Trip Duration
The graph above shows the number of bikes that were checked out on rides vs the trip duration. The panel A shows trips that lasted from 0-60minutes (ie hour 0), panel b shows trips that lasted 60-120 minutes, and panel c shows trips that lasted 120-180 minutes. The trip duration for any ride drastically decreases after about 5 minutes suggesting that riders are mostly taking small rides that are 0-5 minutes long and few riders are taking trips up to 60 minutes long.

## Page 3: Bike Riders Trip Duration by Gender
This graph shows a similar trend as the previous one. As expected the male riders are renting the most amount of bikes. The male riders are also taking longer trips than the female and unknown riders. 

## Page 4: Number of Trips By Usertype, Gender, and Weekday
This visualization shows the number of trip (less = light green, more= dark green) that where taken by male, female, and unknown riders sorted by whether or not they are a subscriber and what day they utilitzed CitiBike. Females are mostly subscribers using the bikes frequently through out the week. Males are mostly subscribers using the bikes primarily Monday through Friday suggesting they may be bike commuters. The unknown riders are mostly non-susbscribers and are riding more frequently on the weekends suggesting they may be tourists.
